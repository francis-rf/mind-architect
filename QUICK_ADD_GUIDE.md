# Mind Architect - Quick Add Feature

## ✅ What's New

I've added a **Quick Add** feature that allows you to add individual entries for ANY mode without going through the full 4-step training session.

## 🚀 How to Use Quick Add

### Step 1: Access Quick Add

On the home screen, click the **⚡ Quick Add Entry** button (right below "Begin Training Session")

### Step 2: Choose Your Mode

Select which type of entry you want to add:

- **👁 Observe** - Record facts and observations (+3 XP)
- **◈ Pattern** - Apply a mental model (+2 XP)
- **? Question** - Ask powerful questions (+3 XP)
- **→ Act** - Document decisions/actions (+5 XP)

### Step 3: For Pattern Mode Only

If you selected Pattern mode, you'll also need to choose a mental model from the dropdown

### Step 4: Write Your Entry

Type your observation, pattern, question, or action in the text area

### Step 5: Submit

Click **Add Entry** to save it and earn XP!

## 📱 Features

✅ **Individual Mode Access** - Add entries for any mode separately
✅ **Mental Model Selection** - Choose from 18 mental models for Pattern entries
✅ **Context Hints** - Each mode shows its prompt and hint
✅ **XP Tracking** - Earn the correct XP for each entry type
✅ **Instant Feedback** - Success alert shows XP earned
✅ **Auto-Reset** - Form clears after submission for quick consecutive entries
